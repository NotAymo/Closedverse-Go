					<p>Welcome to the FAQ page! If you have any questions about Indigo, this page will eventually answer them.</p>
                                        <h2>I'm trying to load a page! It's still not loading!</h2>
                                        <p>That's not even written as a question! The servers often are busy taking other requests. Please try again at another time</p>
                                        <h2>Why when I'm using a Wifi router, it says I'm banned, but when I'm using another router, I'm unbanned?</h2>
                                        <p>Because that WiFi router's IP address is banned, but not your account. Don't worry, you aren't banned. This is fixable but you will need to contact either<a href="/users/Pikacraft64">Pip</a> or <a href="/users/Miles">Miles</a>and follow our steps.</p>
                                        <h2>I used <i>insert Miiverse clone here</i> for awhile, and I left at some point. Why should I come back?</h2>
                                        <p>Well, no one is forcing you, but this clone has been in the works for months. Hours of work was put into this place. This was made by people who actually care about improving the site and making it grow. We do our absolute best to make sure everything is peaceful and fun.<p>
					<h2>Do eggs?</h2>
